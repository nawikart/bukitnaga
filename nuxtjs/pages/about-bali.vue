                    <p class="title">ABOUT UBUD, BALI</p>

                    <p>Ubud is a remarkable town in the middle of the island of Bali, north of Denpasar and situated on Bali’s scenic hillsides. For more than a century, it has been the island's preeminent centre for fine arts, dance and music. Ubud has become a global hot spot for literati, glitterati, art collectors and connoisseurs. Famous names walk its busy sidewalks while elegant five star hotels and sprawling villas now stand on its outskirts, overlooking the most prized views in Bali. Ubud has retained its eclectic and traditional spirit, drawing people actively involved in art, nature, anthropology, music, dance, architecture, environmentalism, "alternative modalities" and more.</p>

                    <p>Ubud is the best place to use as a base if you're visiting Bali looking for culture, comfort, nature and inspiration. Ubud is surrounded by most of the things that bring people to Bali -- scenic rice fields, small villages, arts and crafts communities, ancient temples, palaces, rivers, excellent shopping and fine dining. And its central location makes it easy to get from Ubud to the mountains, beaches, and major towns.</p>

                    <p class="subheading">CLIMATE</p>

                    <p>Bali is blessed with a near-constant temperature somewhere between 20 and 33 degrees Celsius (70-90 degrees Fahrenheit). Expect a brief daily shower December into March, which offers a mid-day respite from the sun. Balmy breezes blow year-round and carry the sweet scent of the island’s Frangipani flower.</p>

                    <p class="subheading">ACTIVITIES</p>

                    <p>Ubud is beautiful all year round and is home to Bali’s most active artisan markets. Visit Ubud’s excellent Wildlife Park or try some white water rafting (seasonal), classes at renowned cooking schools, the Bali Elephant Safari and guided hikes to Bali’s sacred volcanoes, plus snorkeling, surfing, scuba and golfing. Any of these can be arranged through Villa Bukit Naga.</p>
